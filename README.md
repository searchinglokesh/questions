# UNIX Systems: Comprehensive Study Guide on Signals, Process Management & Sessions

## Signal Handling and Management

### Q1: Why aren't signal handlers preserved across an exec system call?
**A:** Signal handlers are not preserved across exec calls for several critical reasons:
- The new program loaded by exec has different memory layout and addresses
- Signal handler functions from the previous program would point to invalid memory locations
- Security considerations require a clean slate for the new program
- The new program may have entirely different signal handling requirements
- Maintaining signal handlers could lead to unpredictable behavior in the new program context

### Q2: What is the rationale behind SIGCHLD being ignored by default?
**A:** SIGCHLD is ignored by default for several practical reasons:
- Most processes don't need to monitor their children's termination
- Prevents unnecessary system overhead
- Automatically prevents zombie process creation when child tracking isn't needed
- Maintains compatibility with historical UNIX behavior
- Simplifies default process management

### Q3: What happens when a signal occurs during critical system calls like fork, exec, or exit?
**A:** Signal handling during critical system calls follows specific rules:
- **During fork:**
  - Signal is inherited by the child process
  - Ensures consistent signal state between parent and child
- **During exec:**
  - Signal is queued and delivered after exec completes
  - Prevents interruption of program loading
- **During exit:**
  - Signals are typically ignored
  - Ensures clean process termination

### Q4: Under what circumstances might a SIGKILL signal not terminate a process immediately?
**A:** A SIGKILL signal might be delayed in these scenarios:
1. Process is in uninterruptible sleep state (D state)
2. Process is completing critical kernel operations
3. System resources required for termination are temporarily unavailable
4. Process is swapped out and must be swapped in first
5. System is under extreme resource pressure

## Process Priority and Sleep States

### Q5: What problems arise from traditional UNIX systems using sleep priority for dual purposes?
**A:** Using sleep priority for both wakeup decisions and scheduling creates several issues:
- **Problems:**
  - Conflates two distinct concerns (wakeup eligibility and scheduling)
  - Can lead to inappropriate scheduling decisions after wakeup
  - Reduces flexibility in priority management
  - Makes system behavior less predictable
- **Modern Solution:**
  - Separate priority values for scheduling and wakeup decisions
  - Independent mechanisms for each purpose
  - More granular control over process behavior

## Signal Handler Persistence

### Q6: What are the implications of persistent signal handlers?
**A:** Persistent signal handlers present several challenges:
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Risk of infinite handling loops
  - Increased complexity in signal management
  - Higher resource consumption
  - Potential for unexpected behavior chains
- **Signals that shouldn't be persistent:**
  - SIGFPE (floating point exceptions)
  - SIGSEGV (segmentation violations)
  - SIGILL (illegal instructions)
  - One-shot initialization signals

## System Call Handling

### Q7: Compare 4.3BSD sigpause with SVR3. When is the BSD version more useful?
**A:** Key differences and applications:
- **4.3BSD sigpause:**
  - Atomically releases signals and enters sleep state
  - Better protection against race conditions
  - Ideal for precise synchronization needs
- **Best used when:**
  - Timing-critical signal handling is required
  - Complex synchronization between processes needed
  - Preventing signal-related race conditions is crucial

### Q8: Why is kernel-level system call restart preferable to user-level handling?
**A:** Kernel-level restart offers several advantages:
1. Simplifies application code
2. Ensures system call consistency
3. Handles corner cases automatically
4. Reduces error-prone user-level recovery code
5. Provides better system stability

## Multiple Signal Handling

### Q9: How are multiple instances of the same signal handled?
**A:** Current behavior and alternatives:
- **Standard Behavior:**
  - Only one instance is queued
  - Additional signals are merged
  - Signal remains pending until handled
- **Potential Alternative Approaches:**
  - Queue-based handling (store all instances)
  - Counter-based tracking
  - Priority-based queuing
  - Signal-specific handling policies

### Q10: How does the kernel manage multiple pending signals?
**A:** The kernel ensures proper handling through:
1. Strict priority ordering
2. Atomic signal delivery
3. Signal mask management
4. Context preservation

- **SVR4:**
  - Any session member can create
  - More flexible management
  - Enhanced control options

## Terminal and Session Control

### Q15: What actions should the kernel take when a session leader deallocates its controlling terminal?
**A:** The kernel should:
1. Notify all session processes
2. Clean up terminal associations
3. Handle orphaned process groups
4. Update process states
5. Manage signal delivery appropriately

### Q16: How does SVR4 handle terminal reconnection?
**A:** SVR4 provides several mechanisms:
- **Methods:**
  - TIOCSCTTY ioctl usage
  - Special device open calls
  - Session leader privileges
- **Applications:**
  - Recovery scenarios
  - Terminal switching
  - Remote session management
  - System administration

## Clock Management and Callouts

### Q1: Why aren't callouts handled by the primary clock interrupt handler?
**A:** Callouts are separated from the primary clock interrupt handler for several critical reasons:
